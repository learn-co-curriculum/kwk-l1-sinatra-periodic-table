1. Instantiate an instance of the element via the dynamic route URL.
2. Render the `element.html.erb` template
3. Use instance variables in an action and pass to view
4. Fill in the parts of that template that should be dynamic based on the instance they found in the controller
5. Build out more model methods for basename and symbol because it only has name and weight.

Stretch

6. Find by name
7. another dynamic route
8. new navigational list
9. new model method Element.new_from_name or something
10. use a layout to reuse the navigational list

some style on this would be nice

so would tests enforcing the code along and making it useable in a lab.
